Using the following commands to build and run the program:

For Linux:
  make linux
  make run

For MacOS:
  make mac <- This should work. If you haven’t got GTK installed yet, downloading
			  Homebrew and then doing ‘brew install gtk+3’ in Terminal is the most
			  pain-free way to go.
  make run

For Windows:
  make win
  make run
